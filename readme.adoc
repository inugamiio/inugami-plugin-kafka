==  Properties :

|===
|Property key| Require | type | default value | description 

|bootstrapServers
|X
|List<String>
|localhost:9092
|Kafka instances list

|topic
|X
|String
|test
|Kafka topic


|groupId
|X
|String
|{{provider name}}
|A unique string that identifies the consumer group this consumer belongs to. This property is required if the consumer uses either the group management functionality by using `subscribe(topic)` or the Kafka-based offset management strategy.


|timeout
|X
|Long
|10000
|


|groupeInstanceId
|
|String
|
|A unique identifier of the consumer instance provided by end user. Only non-empty strings are permitted. If set, the consumer is treated as a static member,  which means that only one instance with this ID is allowed in the consumer group at any time.  This can be used in combination with a larger session timeout to avoid group rebalances caused by transient unavailability (e.g. process restarts). If not set, the consumer will join the group as a dynamic member, which is the traditional behavior.


|maxPoolRecords
|
|Integer
|
|The maximum number of records returned in a single call to poll().


|maxPoolInterval
|
|Integer
|
|The maximum delay between invocations of poll() when using  consumer group management. This places an upper bound on the amount of time that the consumer can be idle  before fetching more records. If poll() is not called before expiration of this timeout, then the consumer is considered failed and the group will rebalance in order to reassign the partitions to another member.


|sessionTimeout
|
|Integer
|
|The timeout used to detect consumer failures when using  Kafka's group management facility. The consumer sends periodic heartbeats to indicate its liveness to the broker. If no heartbeats are received by the broker before the expiration of this session timeout, then the broker will remove this consumer from the group and initiate a rebalance. Note that the value  must be in the allowable range as configured in the broker configuration by "group.min.session.timeout.ms" and `group.max.session.timeout.ms`


|heartBeatMs
|
|Integer
|
|The expected time between heartbeats to the consumer coordinator when using Kafka's group management facilities. Heartbeats are used to ensure that the consumer's session stays active and to facilitate rebalancing when new consumers join or leave the group. The value must be set lower than `session.timeout.ms`, but typically should be set no higher than 1/3 of that value. It can be adjusted even lower to control the expected time for normal rebalances.


|enableAutoComit
|
|Boolean
|true
|If true the consumer's offset will be periodically committed in the background.


|autoComitIntervalMs
|
|Integer
|5000
|The frequency in milliseconds that the consumer offsets are auto-committed to Kafka if "enable.auto.commit" is set to `true`.


|partitionAssigmentStrategy
|
|String
|
|The class name of the partition assignment strategy that the client will use to distribute partition ownership amongst consumer instances when group management is used


|autoOffsetRest
|
|String
|
|What to do when there is no initial offset in Kafka or if the current offset does not exist any more on the server (e.g. because that data has been deleted):

* earliest: automatically reset the offset to the earliest offset
* latest: automatically reset the offset to the latest offset
* none: throw exception to the consumer if no previous offset is found for the consumer's group
* anything else: throw exception to the consumer.


|fetchMinBytes
|
|Integer
|1
|The minimum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. If insufficient data is available the request will wait for that much data to accumulate before answering the request. The default setting of 1 byte means that fetch requests are answered as soon as a single byte of data is available or the fetch request times out waiting for data to arrive. Setting this to something greater than 1 will cause the server to wait for larger amounts of data to accumulate which can improve server throughput a bit at the cost of some additional latency.


|fetchMaxBytes
|
|Integer
|5242880
|The maximum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. Records are fetched in batches by the consumer, and if the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this value, the record batch will still be returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress. As such, this is not a absolute maximum. The maximum record batch size accepted by the broker is defined via `message.max.bytes` (broker config) or `max.message.bytes` (topic config). Note that the consumer performs multiple fetches in parallel.


|fetchMaxWaitMs
|
|Integer
|500
|The maximum amount of time the server will block before answering the fetch request if there isn't sufficient data to immediately satisfy the requirement given by fetch.min.bytes.


|metadataMaxAge
|
|Long
|300000L
|The period of time in milliseconds after which we force a refresh of metadata even if we haven't seen any partition leadership changes to proactively discover any new brokers or partitions.


|maxPartitionFetchBytes
|
|Integer
|1048576
|The maximum amount of data per-partition the server will return. Records are fetched in batches by the consumer. If the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this limit, the  batch will still be returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress. The maximum record batch size accepted by the broker is defined via "message.max.bytes" (broker config) or  `max.message.bytes` (topic config). See `fetchMaxBytes` configuration for limiting the consumer request size.


|sendBuffer
|
|Integer
|131072
|The size of the TCP send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) to use when sending data. If the value is -1, the OS default will be used.


|receiveBuffer
|
|Integer
|65536
|The size of the TCP receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) to use when reading data. If the value is -1, the OS default will be used.


|clientId
|
|String
|{{provider name}}
|An id string to pass to the server when making requests. The purpose of this is to be able to track the source of requests beyond just ip/port by allowing a logical application name to be included in server-side request logging.


|clientRack
|
|String
|
|A rack identifier for this client. This can be any string value which indicates where this client is physically located. It corresponds with the broker config 'broker.rack'


|reconnectBackoffMs
|
|Long
|50L
|The base amount of time to wait before attempting to reconnect to a given host. This avoids repeatedly connecting to a host in a tight loop. This backoff applies to all connection attempts by the client to a broker.


|retryBackoff
|
|Long
|100L
|The amount of time to wait before attempting to retry a failed request to a given topic partition. This avoids repeatedly sending requests in a tight loop under some failure scenarios.


|metricsSampleWindowMs
|
|Long
|30000L
|The window of time a metrics sample is computed over


|metricsNumSample
|
|Long
|30000L
|The number of samples maintained to compute metrics.


|metricsRecordingLevel
|
|String
|
|The highest recording level for metrics.


|checkCrcs
|
|Boolean
|true
|Automatically check the CRC32 of the records consumed. This ensures no on-the-wire or on-disk corruption to the messages occurred. This check adds some overhead, so it may be disabled in cases seeking extreme performance.


|connectionsMaxIdleMs
|
|Long
|60000L
|Close idle connections after the number of milliseconds specified by this config.


|requestTimeout
|
|Integer
|30000
|The configuration controls the maximum amount of time the client will wait for the response of a request. If the response is not received before the timeout elapses the client will resend the request if necessary or fail the request if retries are exhausted.


|defaultApiTimeoutMs
|
|Integer
|60000
|Specifies the timeout (in milliseconds) for consumer APIs that could block. This configuration is used as the default timeout for all consumer operations that do not explicitly accept a `timeout` parameter.


|excludeInternalTopics
|
|Boolean
|true
|Whether internal topics matching a subscribed pattern should be excluded from the subscription. It is always possible to explicitly subscribe to an internal topic.


|defaultExcludeInternalTopics
|
|Boolean
|true
|


|leaveGroupOnClose
|
|Boolean
|true
|Whether or not the consumer should leave the group on close. If set to `false` then a rebalance won't occur until session.timeout.ms expires. Note: this is an internal configuration and could be changed in the future in a backward incompatible way


|isolationLevel
|
|String
|
|how to read messages written transactionally. If set to `read_committed`, consumer.poll() will only return transactional messages which have been committed. If set to `read_uncommitted` (the default), consumer.poll() will return all messages, even transactional messages which have been aborted. Non-transactional messages will be returned unconditionally in either mode. Messages will always be returned in offset order. Hence, in  `read_committed` mode, `consumer.poll()` will only return messages up to the last stable offset (LSO), which is the one less than the offset of the first open transaction. In particular any messages appearing after messages belonging to ongoing transactions will be withheld until the relevant transaction has been completed. As a result, `read_committed` consumers will not be able to read up to the high watermark when there are in flight transactions. Further, when in "read_committed" the seekToEnd method will return the LSO


|allowAutoCreateTopics
|
|Boolean
|true
|Allow automatic topic creation on the broker when" subscribing to or assigning a topic. A topic being subscribed to will be automatically created only if the broker allows for it using `auto.create.topics.enable` broker configuration. This configuration must be set to `false` when using brokers older than 0.11.0


|batchSize
|
|Integer
|16384
|The producer will attempt to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are being sent to the same partition. This helps performance on both the client and the server. This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes. No attempt will be made to batch records larger than this size. Requests sent to brokers will contain multiple batches, one for each partition with data available to be sent. A small batch size will make batching less common and may reduce throughput (a batch size of zero will disable batching entirely). A very large batch size may use memory a bit more wastefully as we will always allocate a buffer of the specified batch size in anticipation of additional records.


|acks
|
|String
|"1"
|The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete. This controls the durability of records that are sent. The following settings are allowed:
 
* `acks=0` : If set to zero then the producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server at all. The record will be immediately added to the socket buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the server has received the record in this case, and the `retries` configuration will not take effect (as the client won't generally know of any failures). The offset given back for each record will always be set to -1.
* `acks=1` : This will mean the leader will write the record to its local log but will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately after acknowledging the record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will be lost.
* `acks=all` : This means the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee. This is equivalent to the acks=-1 setting.


|lingerMs
|
|Long
|0L
|The producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the client may want to reduce the number of requests even under moderate load. This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay&mdash;that is, rather than immediately sending out a record the producer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together. This can be thought "of as analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching: once we get `batchSize` configuration worth of records for a partition it will be sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this partition we will 'linger' for th specified time waiting for more records to show up. This setting defaults to 0 (i.e. no delay). Setting `lingerMs=5`,  for example, would have the effect of reducing the number of requests sent but would add up to 5ms of latency to records sent in the absence of load.


|deliveryTimeoutMs
|
|Integer
|120000
|An upper bound on the time to report success or failure after a call to `send()` returns. This limits the total time that a record will be delayed prior to sending, the time to await acknowledgement from the broker (if expected), and the time allowed for retriable send failures. The producer may report failure to send a record earlier than this config if either an unrecoverable error is encountered, the retries have been exhausted, or the record is added to a batch which reached an earlier delivery expiration deadline. The value of this config should be greater than or equal to the sum of `requestTimeout` and `lingerMs`.


|maxRequestSize
|
|Integer
|1048576
|The maximum size of a request in bytes. This setting will limit the number of record batches the producer will send in a single request to avoid sending huge requests. This is also effectively a cap on the maximum record batch size. Note that the server  has its own cap on record batch size which may be different from this.


|maxBlockMs
|
|Long
|60000
|The configuration controls how long `KafkaProducer.send()` and `KafkaProducer.partitionsFor()` will block. These methods can be blocked either because the buffer is full or metadata unavailable. Blocking in the user-supplied serializers or partitioner will not be counted against this timeout.


|bufferMemory
|
|Long
|33554432
|The total bytes of memory the producer can use to buffer records waiting to be sent to the server. If records are sent faster than they can be delivered to the server the producer will block for `maxBlockMs` after which it will throw an exception. This setting should correspond roughly to the total memory the producer will use, but is not a hard bound since not all memory the producer uses is used for buffering. Some additional memory will be used for compression (if  compression is enabled) as well as for maintaining in-flight requests.


|compressionType
|
|String
|"none"
|The compression type for all data generated by the producer. The default is none (i.e. no compression). Valid  values are `none`, `gzip`, `snappy`, `lz4`, or `zstd<`. Compression is of full batches of data, so the efficacy of batching will also impact the compression ratio (more batching means better compression).


|maxInFlightRequestsPerConnection
|
|Integer
|5
|The maximum number of unacknowledged requests the client will send on a single connection before blocking.  Note that if this setting is set to be greater than 1 and there are failed sends, there is a risk of  message re-ordering due to retries (i.e., if retries are enabled).


|retries
|
|Integer
|50
|Setting a value greater than zero will cause the client to resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error. Note that this retry is no different than if the client resent the record upon receiving the error. Allowing retries without setting `maxInFlightRequestsPerConnection` to 1 will potentially change the ordering of records because if two batches are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the records in the second batch may appear first. Note additionally that produce requests will be failed before the number of retries has been exhausted if the timeout configured by `deliveryTimeoutMs` expires first before successful acknowledgement. Users should generally prefer to leave this config unset and instead use `deliveryTimeoutMs` to control retry behavior.


|enableIdempotence
|
|Boolean
|false
|When set to 'true', the producer will ensure that exactly one copy of each message is written in the stream. If 'false', producer retries due to broker failures, etc., may write duplicates of the retried message in the stream. Note that enabling idempotence requires `maxInFlightRequestsPerConnection` to be less than or equal to 5, `retries` to be greater than 0 and `acks` must be 'all'. If these values  are not explicitly set by the user, suitable values will be chosen. If incompatible values are set,  a `ConfigException` will be thrown.


|transactionTimeout
|
|Integer
|60000
|The maximum amount of time in ms that the transaction coordinator will wait for a transaction status update from the producer before proactively aborting the ongoing transaction. If this value is larger than the transaction.max.timeout.ms setting in the broker, the request will fail with a `InvalidTransactionTimeout` error.


|transactionId
|
|String
|
|The TransactionalId to use for transactional delivery. This enables reliability semantics which span multiple producer sessions since it allows the client to guarantee that transactions using the same TransactionalId have been completed prior to starting any new transactions. If no TransactionalId is provided, then the producer is limited to idempotent delivery. Note that `enable.idempotence` must be enabled if a TransactionalId is configured.  he default is `null`, which means transactions cannot be used.  Note that, by default, transactions require a cluster of at least three brokers which is the recommended setting for production; for development you can change this, by adjusting broker setting `transaction.state.log.replication.factor`.
